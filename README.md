# Weather Project Repository

Welcome to the Weather Project Repository! This repository contains a React-based project that fetches weather data from an API and displays weather information for various cities in Turkey.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- API: An external weather API to fetch weather data.
- HTML and CSS: Markup and styling for the web application.

## Features

- **City Selection:** Users can select a city from a list of Turkish cities.
- **Weather Display:** The application displays weather-related information for the selected city, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **API Integration:** The project integrates with an external weather API to fetch real-time weather data.
